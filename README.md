This project will serve as a simple boilerplate to build applications with Next JS + Apollo + GraphQL. Therefore I will not need to build it again, just download the code and start.

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

Then open the browser and go to http://localhost:3000/

The project is just that simple. I want to add tailwind or some CSS Framework, but I think it will not be necessary, because the CSS is in Netuno.

Its just a way to get started with projects that requires this kind of technology. I think that will be important for the script automator.

The anti-configuration package that I will create to never write again "create react-app", "create next-app" or something like that.

Projects today has so many technology that you just take something like 10 of configurations and downloading packages.

Example:

- Frontend is like: NextJS + Tailwind/MaterialUI/Chakra or something like that + GraphQL (Apollo/URQL) / Rest API (React Query/SWR or something like that) + Typescript/Javascript.
  Backend: NodeJs => NestJs/Express/Fastify/Koa + Redis + Prisma/TypeORM/ADONIS/Sequelize + MongoDB/MySQL/PostgreSQL/PlanetScale

All those things come with their own configuration and packages to install. That should be more ease maybe with CLI as NestJs does or something else.
